# Anti Progress bar
Anti-Progress Bar üò†
Almost done‚Ä¶ but in reverse.

This is a fun, satirical web project that subverts the classic progress bar. Instead of completing, it starts at 99% and slowly works its way backward to 0%, only to "crash" and restart the cycle. It's a game of patience and futility, complete with achievements, a "time wasted" tracker, and interactive controls with ironic twists.

‚ú® Features
Reverse Progress: The bar starts at 99% and never reaches 100%. It only goes down!

Humorous Status Updates: Displays a variety of funny, nonsensical messages like "Polishing pixels‚Ä¶" or "Negotiating with the progress bar union‚Ä¶".

Ironic Controls: Buttons like "Pause," "Cancel," and "Speed Up" have unexpected, counter-intuitive effects.

Crash & Burn: When the bar hits 0%, the UI shakes and drops down before resetting to a high percentage to start the "progress" all over again.

Gamified Wasted Time: Earn "achievements" for milestones like wasting 5 minutes or witnessing 5 crashes. All progress is saved to your browser's local storage.

Totally Serious Leaderboard: See how your "time wasted" stacks up against other totally real individuals.
